# Cryptography318
Cryptography318 is a package intended to provide utility for important cryptographic and
linear algebra functions in Python. This package includes functions for generating primes, 
primality tests including AKS, Miller-Rabin, Baillie-PSW, functions for factoring integers including
Pollard's P-1, Quadratic Sieve and Lenstra's Elliptic Curve factorization algorithm, functions for solving 
discrete logarithm problems including index calculus method, Pollard's Rho method for logarithms, 
baby-step-giant-step, and Pohlig-Hellman, support for working with Elliptic Curves including 'fast 
power algorithm' and baby-step-giant-step, general algebra functions such as Chinese Remainder and the 
Euclidean Extended Algorithm for gcd's, and support for matrices including Matrix and Linear Map objects 
that extend numpy's array to include more functionality such as solving non-square systems, solving 
systems over the field of integers, change-of-basis, etc.
